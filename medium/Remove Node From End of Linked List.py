        # n is given

        # first instincts: reverse the list. but that's overkill, i think 
        # only way to remove it it to have known lenght of the list. subtract n from lenght. lets say this is m
        # then remove mth node
        # we can check lenght with fast and slow node

        # another way is to move the n steps ahead.
        # then move fast from nth and slow from head. 
        # the diff between them is constant of n. 

        # to make sure we don't lose our head, make a dummy
